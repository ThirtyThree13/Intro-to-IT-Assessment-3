								<h2 class="major">Team Profile: Matthew Long</h2>
								<h3>Personal Information</h3>
								<p>My IT interest is in networking and system administration. I have some experience as a system administrator in defence and from my Diploma of IT that I completed in 2019. My non-IT related hobbies are, photography – mostly nature and cars but slowly branching out into taking photos of people and four-wheel driving which connects well with my first hobby, as I can drive to some of the best places in the country and take photos of my adventures. I have a diverse background in IT as during my Diploma studies I was exposed to various areas of IT and the roles they play in the modern world. This exposure is what allowed me to follow my passion for networking and administration and helped align me with my career.</p>
								<br>
								<h3>Group Process</h3>
								<p>The biggest change in process between assignment 2 and assignment 3 is the removal of sub performing team members. The communication between the group in assignment 2 was very hot and cold, with some points the group working and contributing well together to reach the outcomes required for the assignment and at other times being unresponsive for 72 hours plus.</p>
								<br>
								<h3>Career Plans</h3>
								<p>The shared focus for career plans is to get into jobs that will allow two things, one being skills and knowledge growth that will see us become better IT professionals. The other was job growth and the ability to have upwards movement in our trade and increased responsibility and expose to systems. My individual job focused on working within the Army is a result of my experience so far, and the passion I have for the outdoors and IT. I think the biggest difference is the number of times spent outdoors in which the Army is defiantly the biggest employer that can provide that pro / con in a job.</p>

						<!-- Overview -->
							<article id="overview">
								<h2 class="major">Overview</h2>
								<p>The main purpose of this project is to create a marketable solution to a variety of clients. The overall outcome of this project is to a. have a complete solution to take to market, b. has some branding and information to pass onto marketing and branding specialists and c. be ready to provide corporate solutions or specific additions to the software for specific major clients. The brought to market solution is expected to have adaptable UI and formatting for ease of integration of marketing solutions and as mentioned, for adding specific corporate branding and any additional add ons requested by clients. Our overall goal in creating a calculator that displays memory is to provide the capability and allow the market to let us fall into multiple grooves that will give us a wide, multimarket reach to provide services and later adaptability to what specific clients ask for when we have established ourselves in the market.
								<p>The larger we can scale our business the more market share we will have and will give us a flow on effect to find new business in new areas that we may not have any application in yet. Working industry by industry will be the best way for us to grow, it will curb the rate we grow at but will sustain and make sure we don’t burn out in industries that we have moved into. Growing like this will also give us key market partners to tailor our solutions for multiple areas of application and give us credibility in each industry as we grow our individual brand and that of those who we partner with / provide solutions to.</p>
								<p>The motivation for out project is to fill a gap in the market that isn’t currently being filled, yes calculators are a mainstream application provided with lots of devices now but the added feature of a past calculation display is what will make us unique to consumers and potentially a larger company like Apple that may want to integrate our features to replace their current calculator application. Our goal is to either be the go-to application in this space or to be bought and be the default for new devices in an ecosystem. </p>
								<p>Many similar products exist but we will beat the competition by being more user friendly and having a smaller size and better written application than any competitor. While these things may not be super noticeable to the individual consumer, to larger companies looking to add the best software as their default on platforms will give us a large lump sum amount of business and increase credibility and brand recognition if we aren’t bought out and brought under a parent company and rebranded.</p>

								<h3>Aims</h3>
								<p>Our main aim is to bring a fully functional, adaptable solution to market with the end user, and application to problems in mind. This aim is the overall goal but to achieve this we can break up our project into multiple areas. The first being the back of house of the application, the main computing function that the user interacts with and the memory that stores the previous calculations. The second is the user interface that will need to be sleek, but still provide ease of use for more industry specific functions as well as clear display of what the current working problem is and separately the previous calculations. </p>
								<p>The back of house application won’t be too complex but creating the most compact software in terms of file size and additional GUI will not be complicated due to the low complexity of the product being brought to market. File size in the base application will be able to be controlled by how the program is coded and how the GUI is formatted. Additional GUI will be required for advanced features or corporate solutions which will decrease our overall file size and increase the ability to provide individual solutions to individual clients. The main function is quite simple and is only basic maths, the secondary function is feasible by creating a space that is written to by the program and read the next time that the program executes the code when the user calculates a new calculation.</p>
								<p>The user interface will focus on ease of use and having a secondary menu for less used functions or specific solutions for clients. One of our main goals in achieving ease of use will be the addition of integrated num pad controls as well as an interactive on-screen keypad for the user to interact with. Having a sleek design will be font and colour choice based, where we will look at different options and potentially a day / night theme for users to choose what suits their colour scheme of their corporate systems or individual taste. The display showing previous calculations will need to not be cluttered and will only show the solution to the previous calculation, this will allow us to provide reference to the user without needing to over clutter the side of the application. An option will be available to show the problem and answer as an advanced feature.</p>
								<br>
								<h3>Plans and Progress</h3>
								<p>The plan follows a simple tracking of progress. Progress will be measured by checkpoints, the first being creation of the background technology that does the computing. Second will be the creation of the GUI that will allow us to use the background technology. Our third checkpoint will be the incorporation of the memory function that is the primary reason for the creation of our software. The fourth will be the advanced features added to the program. The fifth checkpoint will be the integration of a more user friendly and aesthetic styling. The sixth will be the incorporation of increased accessibility for users by adding in keyboard support as a direct input into the application. The seventh checkpoint and last checkpoint will be the end stable state where we have entered the market, can provide ongoing support for users, and explore new features or versions for specific solutions. All our checkpoints are small in comparison to some areas that have been deciders for other similar projects with similar timeframe and access to assess and attempt to provide the end user with the best and most up to date product.</p>
								<p>The first checkpoint will be done by coding in python to create a simple and effective base that we can draw on later for advanced features and provide the main functionality of the program. Overall, this will be up to the discretion of the coder but more than likely the first gate will be completed quite fast allowing us more time to work on the more advanced functions in the program that are found on a normal calculator application as well as integration of the memory feature. Memory integration and output will be the hardest / lengthiest part of the product progress.</p>
								<p>The second checkpoint will be more of a dev only view of the application where only the most basic GUI will be developed for a testing only environment where the achievements of checkpoint one. This gate focuses on early testing to ensure that moving forward until checkpoint five the coders will be able to effectively test and use the program as they complete checkpoints. This is the first checkpoint where we can effectively test and use the application that is being created. As more content is added to the application, we will have to maintain uniformity with what is already set as the standard, and this foresight will allow us to edit the look and style of the application later potentially in a uniform manner that will be handy for checkpoint six but also for corporate solutions as well as individual application.</p>
								<p>The third checkpoint is what separates our software from the competition so the way we add this feature is of the upmost importance. The best planned way pre-beta is to add in a loop that writes the current problems answer on execution on the main display and rewrites the previous entry into a secondary line where it can be drawn from into the side display showing the previous solutions and or problems. This will be repeated all the way along the chain, until the end usable line where the solution is removed from the memory chain (end usable line number is yet to be determined but will be decided based on a number of factors including the font size of the numpad, secondary display size and the button size) as running a scroll bar will add to clutter and most numbers will have lost relevance after 5-10 problems. This will continue where the second saved will become the third and the third becomes the fourth and so on in order.</p>
								<p>The fourth checkpoint is a bit ambiguous on purpose, by this stage of development we will know what sort of formatting we will have and the best way to integrated multiple features. I see this going in one of two ways, the first is a pop open side bar that displays a list of groupings based on use, eg. geometry, fractions, percentages that allows for easier accessibility and organizing of options. The second is a more refined advanced features menu that may not have as wide an option of application but is a layer less for user access and would prompt the user to be more efficient in how they use our application or even simplify how they do things to reduce the risk of mis entering the information and just having an answer spat out, by pushing the user to pursue the answer step by step until they have completed the overall problem.</p>
								<p>The fifth is the most important GUI update, this is where the default will be decided as well as the integration of elements that allow our product to look professional and well built, such as a task bar logo and proper resolution desktop icon integrated into the background so it isn’t something that is thought about but more of an automatically assigned trait to the system rather than being set by administrators or the user trying to improve how the application looks. This is also where the greatest freedom should be applied to the beta testers so that they can decide on how they, as the most common users so far decide on what makes the program pleasing to look at and maintain a business or personal aesthetic. Care will be taken to make the look of the program as adaptable as possible. Ideally, we could create a modifiable styling sheet that dictates logo directory as well as colours used as primary, secondary, and tertiary.</p>
								<p>The sixth checkpoint will be easy to apply to the base application as almost all function will have a key binding on the basic num pad provided on most computers and depending on development could be completed as a concurrent task to decrease the time until completion and help bring the application to market sooner. The sixth checkpoint will not be relevant to the advanced features added as that will rely on the user input through the GUI created in checkpoint five.</p>
								<p>The seventh checkpoint will be the longest because of two factors, one being that it is the solid state where we still provide support to our userbase post release and two, because this includes integration of a support team that can work around with any problems that may arise for our corporate clients that are running their own versions of our project. This support should be contract based and focus on aligning support and solutions for problems that may arise for one client and then another, allowing us to provide the same solution for other clients and standardize response and standard operating procedures that will allow us to keep a level of quality control to support our outcomes that are provided to clients.</p>
								<p>Overall, the planning on the project is easily separatable and by dividing the workload provides the ability to HOTO to another development team should the need arise. This also adds the capability to expand and create a second team should the funding come around to work on the project and decrease the time to market while working concurrently.  It can be expected from our current plans that at least two teams will be directly involved with the project. The first is the development team that will create the actual program and the second is the support / sales team that will focus on getting our project onto sales platforms like Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store. By adding ourselves to these markets we will be able to add a layer of credibility to our product and entice the more casual consumer to try our product. Having a single point of contract and valuing corporate business will also serve us well but with a product like ours, it is a safe assumption that word of mouth will be one of our biggest advertisers and allow us to spread quickly. This project is very achievable and when segmented it really highlights how each smaller goal can be worked through and influences what the end state looks like for the teams and the product that we provide to consumers.</p>

						<!-- Detailed Descriptions -->
							<article id="detaileddescriptioncont">
								<h2 class="major">Detailed Description Cont.</h2>
								<h3>Roles</h3>
								<p>The roles and responsibilities of members in our teams will be dependent on what checkpoint we are at. As we are creating software the amount of people required is minimal as all our distribution is digital, most of our solutions postproduction will require developers who we hope to retain from the original development team. Our secondary team will consist of support and sales personnel that will be our link to larger corporate clients and any individuals that find problems or glitches with our program. Both teams will work under the owner of the company and a team leader that has a 2IC, expected team size is roughly 10 for development and 10 for sales.</p>
								<br>
								<h3>Scope and Limits</h3>
								<p>The scope and limit of this project are not massive but rather defined by the needs of the consumer. Our initial product will remain the same regardless of the needs of consumers as the base system is what we want to bring to market and then improve on and create individual solutions for larger clients or adapt when integrated as part of a base OS. When improving on what is achieves past checkpoint 7 is when we will integrate ideas and needs of our users so that we can continue to provide the best product in the market. The time frame of this project is expected to be over three weeks with a large time spent in integrating our solution into digital markets and fault finding on different operating systems and Approaching logic customers that we think we could assist and create better solutions then what is currently used by their company. Past this the timeline is dependent on what need there is in the market for our product.</p>
								<br>
								<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
								<p>Python will be the biggest technology that is used in this project because it will be the coding language used to create all the back end and integrate the GUI that the user interacts with. Photoshop will also be used so that we can create standard and scalable elements that the user interacts with on multiple platforms so that we can keep a standard looking program for the user regardless of if they are using our software on their phone or their computer or their iPad. I have some experience with Python and a lot with Photoshop and creating elements in Photoshop is more of an art then a science and so will take quite a bit of back and forth to ensure that the scalability of buttons and screen size for the output of calculations are correct. My experience with Python is very simple but can overall achieve the goal required and with assistance improve upon what base layer back end is created.</p>
								<br>
								<h3>Testing</h3>
								<p>Testing will be conducted from the second checkpoint onwards using a basic mockup that is pre-programmed into Python that will allow us to firstly ensure that all the functionality's included work correctly together and individually. The second largest phase of testing will be adapting the programme too different size screens on mobile devices and creating a scalable solution for on PCs so that the user can move our programme to be flexible into whatever workspace they currently have. Ongoing testing requirements will be dictated by the complexity of the individual solution.</p>
								<br>
								<h3>Timeframe</h3>
								<p></p>
								<br>
								<h3>Risks</h3>
								<p>The biggest risk present for this project is that when expecting to scale and be adaptable for multiple screen sizes and resolutions is that we may run into issues where potentially the GUI scales, but the buttons do not but in a situation where if the buttons are downsized enough they will warp and disfigure the GUI. Another foreseeable risk is that Photoshop when integrated will not provide inadequate platform for the creation of GUI elements or even create problems in having a uniform system through the different buttons and displays. Another risk we may encounter is with the back end being completely coded in Python some systems may not be able to read Python And thus remove us from the market that device sits on stopping us from reaching a larger audience and being the go-to solution in the calculator market.</p>
								<br>
								<h3>Group Processes</h3>
								<p>Microsoft team seems like the best solution in this sort of environment the collaboration tools and chat functionality as well as the meeting system that is in place provides an all-in-one solution for the team to share, plan and create. The expected meeting time frame would be a morning meeting to discuss what we hope to achieve during the day, a midday meeting to discuss any problems they have been run into that day so far and then an end of day meeting discussing what was achieved that afternoon and what sort of forecasts we're looking at tomorrow. these meetings don't need to be long, anything longer than 15 minutes to half an hour would be excessive unless directly discussing a problem encountered that requires multiple eyes on it to fix.</p>
